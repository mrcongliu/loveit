I used to think there was no talent for sports in me.

For me, life before primary school wasn't that much fun. I had always been locked inside my bedroom because my parents had to work outside all day.

Sometimes, my mother worried about me and would rush back home to check whether I was chill. Not willing to disturb me with her existence, she would lean towards the window of my room. It was a relief to see me enjoying my time with toys and murmuring to me.

Based on that, you can probably see no talent in me for sports. Even though I had worked in a factory for almost two years and improved my body to a new level, I wasn't satisfied.

After I built my own VPN in China, I started to watch some fitness channels on YouTube. Gradually, I realized that everyone can exercise, and there is no such thing as poor talent. For example, I always thought I couldn't do pull-ups. When I asked the people around me, they all said that if you do can one pull-up a day, you can do more over time. Sadly, I couldn't do even one. Later, Chris Heria's video had the most influence on me. His pull-up tutorial made me understood that if a person can't even do a pull-up, he can also do it through two ways: 
1. Hanging on the horizontal bar at rest

2. Find a low-height horizontal bar to perform pull-back pull-ups with both feet touching the ground

Two days ago, at YMCA Stock Family, I met a buddy who seems very professional with training. So, I humbly asked for his advice on how to increase the number of pull-ups. He gave me some pertinent advice:

1. For each set of pull-ups, when you are exhausted, stay at the highest point for as long as possible, which can maximize the stimulation for muscles.

2. Tie a small weight of plate to the waist and do pull-ups.

3. Set a realistic goal and stick to it: In July, do three sets of three pull-ups per training day; In August, do three sets of three pull-ups per training day; In September, do three sets of five pull-ups per training day.

With a smile on his face, he promised I would do ten pull-ups in one row in October if I stick to this plan.

I decided to repay his advice with hardword and determination.
