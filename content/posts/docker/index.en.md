Over the past one year, I've been using Docker intensively because of the way company's code base was designed, using `docker-compose up` to run each service either seperately or together. My shallow understanding of this tool is that it is a container that stores the code, and start each sub folder (front-end, back-end, database...) with one command. But I never paid too much attention to it, cause I thought I don't need to learn it. I couldn't be more wrong...
