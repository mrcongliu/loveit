### 什么是学习计划

学习计划是加拿大申请学签中最重要的材料。

### 我的第一封学习计划

Dear Visa Officers,

My name is Michael De Santa with passport Z87654321 born on July 6th, 1965, in Los Santos city. My undergraduate education was completed at Stanford University from Sep 1983 to Jun 1987 in Stanford, California. After that, I worked as a Shift Chemical Technician from Dec 1987 to May 1989 in Singapore. Then I prepared for the TOEFL iBT test and got a score of 120 on Dec 16, 1989. In 1990, I found a great passion for programming and decided to be a self-taught programmer. 

Here are some of my online certificates:
- Stanford Machine Learning Engineer
- Google Data Engineer
- AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional
- AWS Certified DevOps Engineer - Professional

Though now I am familiar with Web Development, Machine Learning, and Data Science, my lack of work experience and a degree in the computer field results in the difficulty of getting interviews by most of the tech companies that I want to work for. Therefore, I need to earn a degree in the computer field while enhancing my knowledge and skills at the same time. After doing some research, I found that all master programs in the computer field in USA usually take two or three years to complete, which seems too long for me. Additionally, the contents of these programs are usually outdated. 

On the contrary, the graduate certificate program of Computer Science at Conestiga College only takes one year and provides students with programming experience and the skills necessary to be a qualified software programmer. In this program, I can study specialized courses taught by highly qualified industry experts. Besides, it provides a co-op program that will allow me to learn in a real workplace environment, which is invaluable for my job seeking after graduation. I believe my education at Conestogo College will make me a qualified programmer who can solve tough technical issues and design computer applications for business. By that time, I should be able to build an eye-catching portfolio and get hired by one of the tech giants in USA.

As the only child in the family, going back to USA and taking good care of my parents after finishing my study is my responsibility. After completing schooling, I will return to USA and begin my work towards contributing to the development of the field of Computer Engineering in my country. 

I sincerely appreciate your time and consideration for my study permit.

Best regards,

Michael De Santa

### 我的第二封学习计划

Dear Visa Officers,

My name is Michael De Santa with passport Z87654321 born on July 6th, 1965, in Los Santos city. My undergraduate education was completed at Stanford University from Sep 1983 to Jun 1987 in Stanford, California. In 1990, I found a great passion for programming and decided to learn more about Computer Science. That’s why I applied for the Computer Science program at Conestiga College. Luckily, I got accepted as its student of Fall 1991. My study permit was approved in Dec 1991.

Due to the Pandemic, I’ve been learning remotely in my home country, USA, for nearly seven months. My first program will end in April 1992. After that, I decided to take another program remotely, from May 1992 to Dec 1992. This probably means that I need a new study permit, because the expiration date for my current study permit approval is Sep 30, 1992. Please notice that I have never entered Canada and only got the study permit approval, not the study permit itself.

I choose to learn a second program remotely for two reasons.

The first reason is that taking a second program, which is the Machine Learning program at Conestiga College, will benefit me further in many ways. Unlike my first program at Conestogo, which mainly focused on developing computer applications, the second program provides specific domain knowledge in Big Data. Since Big Data is relatively a new technology, there is a high talent gap on the market. According to a study published by the USA website usa.com, USA largely dominates the Big Data industry with nearly 60% of the world’s experts. Despite this, both Canada and USA still face a lack of qualified professionals in this field. Therefore, I am confident that I can get hired as a Big Data Engineer in USA or Canada.

Due to the travel restrictions, I may not be able to travel to Canada right now. This means that I have to learn remotely in the near future. Even though, by completing two study programs online from outside Canada, I will still be eligible for a PGWP after graduation. It will probably allow me to gain valuable Canadian work experience, which can grant decisive points for immigration in the future. Besides, this program also provides an optional co-op work term, in which I can enhance my skills in a working environment.

On the following page, you can see my marks for the previous semester. I sincerely appreciate your time and consideration for my second study permit.

Best regards,

Michael De Santa
