## Reason 1 Too many bad customers

Nine out of ten people I met calling Uber Eats don't pay tips. There is even a guy asking me to deliver the food to 18th floor inside an apartment with NO PARKING space.

## Reason 2 Parking is always a headache

Especially in downtown Kitchener or near the students' apartments in Waterloo, the only place I can park is curbside, which is super dangerous because the ticket is not cheap. My whole day's earning wouldn't cover that.

## Reason 3 Uber gives low-ball tasks all the time

It is not uncommon to recieve low-ball tasks like driving 10km for 4 dollars. Most cases I will reject them, but then Uber just stop giving me new ones. Last Saturday, I spent the whole afternoon (4~5 hours), just earned 50 dollars, that's not close to 12 dollars per hour.

## Reason 4 Some places are hard to find, and Uber takes no responsibility for that

I remember took a task going into a townhoue zone. There is no unit number on Google Map, neither on Uber's own map. So I couldn't find it. That doesn't feel good for me or to the customers.

Therefore, I would not suggest anyone to do Uber Eats unless you are really in need of money.
