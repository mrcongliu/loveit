> I believe that 18 to 28 years old had formed the foundation of my life, which is continously figuring out the things I don't like. For the past decade, I've completed the tranformation from a boy who suffered a few high risk/pressure jobs, unemployeed, unpaid overtime, to a man who became an international student in Canada and got hired before graduation. To sum it up, I am glad I made those though decisions that changed my life. I would always come back here and review the lessons and successes.

# Where It Begins

## Middle School: a lot of time wasted learning useless knowledge

In China, students in middle schools were expected to learn NINE Subjects: Chinese, Math, English, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Politics, History, and Geography. I learned hard just want to make everyone happy. There was one time I scored 90 out of 100 for all the subjects, and that's the reason I got my first computer--a reward from my parents for being a "good student". I have to admit I don't remember anything I learned those years. Btw, I wish I still have that kind of brain today, so I could remember all the libraries I imported.

Those subejcts are everything that matters. Nobody except girls or student athletes paid much attention to sports. If you spend much time on your hobbies, like reading a novel or playing computer, your parents and teachers will punish you. Teachers liked to host supplementary classes on weekends so they can earn more. And parents were happy to pay extra money to ensure their kids were up-to-speed. I wish I could used the few hundred bucks to buy a phone instead of learning those useless knowledge.

Not being able to enjoy my weekends bothered me. So I quit. Later, I found out that some essential lessons related to geting a high score were removed from weekdays, and I didn't give a shit.

## I hate the Corrupted Education System in China

Basically, there was a transition period in high schools in China that every student will be divided into different classes based on their acadmic scores. This seemed like a good thing. Students with a high score will easily form a good learning momentum, and they will have a relatively good teacher to make sure the overall academic performance.

However, score was not the single reason that determines which class the student will be sent to. Some rich or powerful parents were willing to pay a fortune to make sure their kids have a bright future. So, one day my parents asked me, whether they should pay some money to my school before the class division. I was irritatived, feeling that they were making fun of my learning ability, knowing that I was always among the top performers regarding exams.

I learned this the hard way that I can't trust schools too much. Yes, I scored high, but not high enough to go into the top classes. So I was sent to class-15, which was mixed of good students and bad ones. It was a perfect example of Gresham's law that bad students who paid drove out good students who didn't.

As might have been expected, studying in that class was a torture. Not only had it destroyed my passion for learning but also sabotaged my performance in college entrance examination.

Gradually, I realized that not all teachers are respectful. Most of them are just businessmen who sell knowledge for a good price.

Gradually, I realized that if you have to beg to get something, then it is better to not ask for it at the first place. If a job makes you sufferring, quit. If an education system makes you hate knowledge, don't be involved. Work-life balance is important. Nobody should be forced to learn on weekends.
